# CDP Agentkit Extension - Farcaster Langchain Toolkit

This toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with Farcaster using Neynar's API. The toolkit provides a wrapper around the Neynar API, allowing agents to interact with Farcaster and perform actions like posting casts.

For TypeScript, see [farcaster-langchain/typescript](./typescript/README.md).
