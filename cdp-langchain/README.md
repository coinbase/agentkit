# CDP Agentkit Extension - Langchain Toolkit

CDP integration with Langchain to enable agentic workflows using the core primitives defined in `cdp-agentkit-core`.

This toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with the [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/). The toolkit provides a wrapper around the CDP SDK, allowing agents to perform onchain operations like transfers, trades, and smart contract interactions.

For Python, see [cdp-langchain/python](./python/README.md).
For TypeScript, see [cdp-langchain/typescript](./typescript/README.md).
